### Project Description
* Data set in the form of a csv file with values for poverty rate, median age, median income, percent uninsured, obesity rate, and smoking rate for each US state
* D3 was used to build a scatter plot in an HTML page. The scatter plot has options of Obesity Rate, Smoking Rate, and Percent Uninsured on the y-axis, and options of Poverty Rate, Median Age, and Median Income on the x-axis. When a new option is selected for an axis variable, the plot transitions so that correlations between multiple variables can be inspected
